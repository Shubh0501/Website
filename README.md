# Personal Website using Vue.js by Shubham Pasari

This project is created using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) which is a progressive Javascript framework. 
This design of the website is inspired from another personal website of [Pascal Van Gemert](http://www.pascalvangemert.nl/#/profile). He has created the website using custom made PHP framework. You can check out his work for more inspiration. 

I have used some of the icons in my website from [icons8](https://icons8.com/) website. 

This entire project was developed using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) which is a great platform for any language.

In case you want to run this project in your own system, you will need to install nodejs and npm. The setup instructions is given below.
